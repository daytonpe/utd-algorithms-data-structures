I used NetBeans IDE to build this project.

RUNNING ON COMMAND LINE
$cd graph
$javac Graph.java Main.java LinkedList.java
$cd ..
$java -cp . graph.Main

WHAT WILL HAPPEN
Adjacency List for G1 will Print for example graph with 10 vertices and 20 edges.
--Ajacency list is shown as 10 singly linked lists.
DFS traversal will be printed.
BFS traversal will be printed.

NOTE
Order in which the Linked Lists are traversed is based on the order in which the edges are added.
One could add a sorting function to traverse in alphabetical/numerical/chronological order depending on the data.
However, this will not change the fact that it is a DFS or BFS algorithm. 

Let me know if you have any questions or have any issues running the code: pxd170130@utdallas.edu
